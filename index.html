    <h1>SnapPixa — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: November 20, 2025</p>

    <p>SnapPixa (“the App”) is a macOS application designed to operate locally on your device. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App accesses, how that information is used, stored, and protected, and the choices you have. The App is developed and maintained by an independent developer.</p>

    <h2>1. Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>SnapPixa does <strong>not</strong> collect personal data by default.</li>
      <li>All core processing happens locally on your Mac.</li>
      <li>No data is transmitted off your device unless you explicitly choose to share or upload it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>By default, SnapPixa does not collect or transmit any of the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal identifiers such as your name, email, address, or location.</li>
      <li>Device identifiers or telemetry used for analytics.</li>
      <li>Behavioral or usage analytics.</li>
      <li>Screenshot or screen content (unless you manually initiate a screen capture within the App).</li>
      <li>Crash logs, except those optionally provided to developers by Apple’s system mechanisms.</li>
      <li>Any information transmitted to external servers without your explicit action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Screen Recording and Screen Capture</h2>
    <p>If your version of SnapPixa includes screen capture or screen recording features, the following applies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User Consent Required:</strong> macOS will ask you to grant Screen Recording permission before the App can access screen content. The App will never enable screen access without your explicit approval.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited Scope:</strong> The App only captures the portion of the screen you select. It does not capture system audio, private files, or keyboard input unless features requiring them are explicitly enabled and granted permission.</li>
      <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All screen data is processed entirely on your Mac. No screen content is transmitted to any server unless you manually choose to upload it.</li>
      <li><strong>Temporary Data:</strong> Any intermediate frames, thumbnails, or OCR input data are stored only in memory or temporary storage and removed immediately after processing.</li>
      <li><strong>No Background Recording:</strong> The App does not record or capture anything when the feature is not actively in use.</li>
      <li><strong>No Hidden Collection:</strong> The App never uses screen recording for analytics, tracking, or monitoring purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Example text used for App Review clarification:</strong>
      <p>“SnapPixa only accesses the portion of the screen the user selects. All screen data is processed locally on the device, never uploaded, never shared with third parties, and never stored after processing unless the user explicitly saves it.”</p>
    </div>

    <h2>4. When Data May Leave Your Device</h2>
    <p>Data will only leave your device if you explicitly choose to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>export or save a file, screenshot, image, or extracted text;</li>
      <li>upload content to a third-party service (email, cloud storage, etc.);</li>
      <li>opt in to a cloud-sync or backup feature (if available).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you do not take one of these actions, no data leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not include analytics SDKs, advertising frameworks, or tracking technologies. If optional integrations are added in future versions, they will be clearly documented in an updated Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Local-First Approach:</strong> All processing is performed on-device.</li>
      <li><strong>Temporary Files:</strong> Any temporary processing data is deleted once processing completes.</li>
      <li><strong>User-Saved Files:</strong> Any files you save will remain stored wherever you chose to store them.</li>
      <li><strong>Crash Logs:</strong> Only Apple-provided crash logs may be available to the developer, subject to Apple’s system settings.</li>
      <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> If optional cloud features are added, communication will use secure industry-standard encryption methods (HTTPS/TLS).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required in your region). The App does not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Choices and Permission Controls (macOS)</h2>
    <p>On macOS, you can control what the App can access:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open <strong>System Settings → Privacy & Security</strong>.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>Screen Recording</strong> to enable or disable SnapPixa’s permission.</li>
      <li>Use <strong>Files & Folders</strong> to control file system access.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Revoking these permissions will disable related features within the App until re-enabled.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When updated, the revised version will be posted with an updated “Last updated” date. Continued use of the App indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
